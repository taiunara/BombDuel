# BombDuel
BombDuel is inspired by FruitDuel and Bomberman, challenging players to hit a target at specific moments of vulnerability. It applies Finite State Machines (FSM), ballistic motion (URM for horizontal, UAM for vertical), and collision detection, creating a dynamic experience that demonstrates key concepts from Applied Mathematics for Multimedia. ðŸš€
