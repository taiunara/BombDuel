# ðŸ’¥ BombDuel

**BombDuel** is a game inspired by **FruitDuel** and **Bomberman**, challenging players to hit a target at specific moments of vulnerability. The game integrates **Finite State Machines (FSM)**, **ballistic motion** (using **Uniform Rectilinear Motion (URM)** for horizontal movement and **Uniformly Accelerated Motion (UAM)** for vertical movement), and **collision detection**, creating a dynamic and strategic gameplay experience.

## ðŸŽ® Features
- **Finite State Machines (FSM)** for character and game state control
- **Physics-based motion** for bomb trajectory calculations
- **Collision detection** for realistic interactions
- **Engaging gameplay** with strategic timing mechanics

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Game

### ðŸ“‚ Assets
All game assets, including images, sounds, and other resources, are located in the **assets** folder.
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/taiunara/BombDuel.git
   cd BombDuel
   ```

2. **Open the project in p5.js**
   - Make sure you have **p5.js** installed. Download it from [p5js.org](https://p5js.org/).
   - Open the `BombDuel.js` file in the p5.js editor or a local development environment.

3. **Run the game**
   - Open the project in a browser using a local server or the p5.js web editor.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Play
- **Press the spacebar** to throw a bomb at the target.
- **Time your attacks** carefully to hit the target when it's vulnerable.
- **Defeat your rival** before they score 10 points to win the game!

## ðŸ’¡ About the Project
This game was developed using **p5.js** as part of an **Applied Mathematics for Multimedia** study, showcasing physics concepts through interactive gameplay. The implementation of **Finite State Machines, motion physics, and collision detection** makes it a valuable learning experience in game development.
