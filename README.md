BombDuel is a game inspired by FruitDuel, combining the bomb-throwing mechanics of Bomberman with a dynamic system where players must hit a target at specific moments of vulnerability. The target's state constantly changes, challenging players to anticipate movements and improve their accuracy.

This project was developed for the Applied Mathematics for Multimedia course, incorporating concepts such as:
âœ… Finite State Machines (FSM) to control character and target states.
âœ… Ballistic motion, using uniform rectilinear motion (URM) for horizontal distance and uniformly accelerated motion (UAM) for vertical movement.
âœ… Collision detection and impact validation to register successful hits and progress through the game.

By blending these elements, BombDuel offers a dynamic and challenging experience, demonstrating how mathematical concepts can be applied in an interactive environment. ðŸš€ðŸŽ¯
